        <h2>Welcome to Zanzibar</h2>
        <p>There are many places to visit and things to do in Zanzibar. The East African island has a lot of things to do and experience. It’s safe to say that excitement and relaxation can be had in every corner of Zanzibar.</p>
        <h2>Discover the Geography</h2>
        <p>Before we jump into this guide of things to do in Zanzibar, let’s focus on geography. Zanzibar is an island in the Indian Ocean, a two-hour (15 miles) ferry ride from Dar Es Salaam, a major city in Tanzania.</p>
        <p>Zanzibar is not a country but is considered a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Politically it is part of Tanzania. Zanzibar is also just one island but is the largest of the Zanzibar Archipelago, which consists of several islands.</p>
        <h2>Top Places to Visit in Zanzibar</h2>
        <p>Looking for where to start once you arrive in Stone Town? Here are the top places to visit in Zanzibar.</p>

        <h2>JOZANI FOREST</h2>
        <p>Jozani Forest is one of the most popular places to visit in Zanzibar. The forest is the last sanctuary in the world to see the Zanzibar red colobus monkey. The forest is in the Eastern part of the island and is one of the lushest places on Zanzibar. It’s a staunch reminder of what we have done to our environment over the centuries.</p>

        <h2>SEAWEED CENTER</h2>
        <p>The Seaweed Center (now called Mwani Zanzibar) is a women’s initiative that employs local women to make products from the abundance of seaweed around the island. Guests can take a full tour to see the daily tasks of the seaweed farmers, or they can relax at the shop with a glass of seaweed fruit juice!</p>

        <h2>HOUSE OF WONDERS</h2>
        <p>When wondering what to do in Zanzibar, a visit to Stone Town is essential. Or the “Palace of Wonders” is the tallest building in Stone Town and a main Zanzibar point of interest. It’s right next to the Old Fort and is a sight to see while in Stone Town.</p>
        <p>It is also the spot for the first elevator in all East Africa. History buffs can learn about the history of Stone Town here and view old exhibits and rooms.</p>

        <h2>DINE AT FORODHANI GARDENS</h2>
        <p>Forodhani Gardens refers to a public park in Stone Town. These gardens are set right in front of its most famous buildings, Old Fort and House of Wonders. It’s sometimes referred to as Jubilee Gardens, Forodhani Park, or the main town square.</p>
        <p>The best time to head here is around sunset. You’ll know when you arrive as your senses will be overwhelmed by the fresh grilled seafood. The open-air food market vendors sell mostly Swahili and Zanzibari cuisine, such as samoosas, seafood, and kebabs.</p>

        <h2>PAJE BEACH</h2>
        <p>For those looking to have an active holiday in Zanzibar, kite surfing is the most popular thing in Paje. There are endless schools and rental shops dying to take you out on the water and show you the ropes of kitesurfing.</p>
        <p>If you’re not a beginner, Paje has the right amount of wind to spend the entire Zanzibar holiday improving your kitesurfing skills. It’s often considered one of the best places in the world to go kite surfing, and it’s easy to understand why when you feel the wind and see the gorgeous water.</p>

        <h2>SPICE TOUR</h2>
        <p>Zanzibar is often referred to as “Spice Island” for its centuries of clove, nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon production and is one of the top five things to do in Zanzibar. Most of these spice tours depart from Stone Town and take you to a large spice farm to see, touch, and taste the many flavors of Zanzibar.</p>

        <h2>ZANZIBAR BUTTERFLY CENTRE</h2>
        <p>The Zanzibar Butterfly Center is near Jozani Forest, so it is a really great experience if you are already in the area. It offers an interactive environment that both children and adults will love.</p>
        <p>With the help of 40 local farmers from a nearby village, butterfly farming is done here. Farming provides a stable income for the farmers while giving back to the environment. At the butterfly center, you can let the butterflies flutter all around you while having an educational visit and learning about conservation.</p>

        <h2>SAFARI BLUE CRUISE</h2>
        <p>On this island, visitors can get the best views of the blue ocean while snorkeling and enjoying the cool morning air with fresh fruit.</p>
        <p>Afterward, there are options to keep snorkeling or see a hidden lagoon before enjoying a seafood buffet lunch on Kwale Island. It is here that there are massive baobabs, small shops, and more beach paradise.</p>

        <h2>PRISON ISLAND</h2>
        <p>Prison Island is one of those great places of interest in Zanzibar. Take a boat just 5 km from Stone Town to reach the iconic Prison Island or Changuu Island to be technical. Built-in the late 1800s, this prison served as an island for slaves, violent prisoners, and quarantines.</p>
        <p>The main joy of visiting prison island is seeing the nearby tortoise sanctuary. Some of the giant Aldabross tortoises also call Seychelles home. Make sure to bring sunblock for the boat transfers and snorkeling.</p>

        <h2>SNORKEL MNEMBA ISLAND</h2>
        <p>If you haven’t gotten your fill of Tanzania’s marine life, you stand your best chance at seeing some incredible tours with a snorkel tour around Mnemba Island.</p>
        <p>Mnemba Island is a small island just 3 km off the coast of Unguja. It’s only 500 meters in diameter, but it is stunning to walk on and enjoy the turquoise blue water. If you are dive certified, you can also book a tour around Mnemba!</p>

        <h2>HAVE DINNER AT THE TEA HOUSE RESTAURANT</h2>
        <p>Honestly, having a meal at this establishment is one of those must-do things in Zanzibar. Anyone wanting a night out in Stone Town should visit the Tea House Restaurant at Emerson on Hurumzi.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is located on top of the boutique hotel in the middle of the kasbah. And it has one of the best views of Stone Town, making it my favorite thing to do in Zanzibar.</p>

        <h2>VISIT THE ROCK</h2>
        <p>The Rock restaurant is synonymous with Zanzibar and is usually mentioned in every best Zanzibar restaurant guide. The restaurant is in Pongwe (the southeast part of the island) and is accessible by motorbike or taxicab from Paje.</p>

        <h2>CATCH PARK HYATT ZANZIBAR HAPPY HOUR</h2>
        <p>For great cocktails in Stone Town, head to the Park Hyatt Zanzibar. A half-price happy hour every day starts at 18:00 and includes all drinks. So if you’re craving a New York cocktail off the coast of Africa, the Park Hyatt is calling your name. We even got our bourbon fix, making us two happy travelers.</p>

        <h2>WANDER THROUGH STONE TOWN</h2>
        <p>One of the best things to do in Zanzibar is wander the streets of Stone Town. There are many unique places to see in Stone Town, including beautiful boutique shops and plenty of fabulous restaurants. Venture around the Forodhani Gardens and the Old Fort!</p>
        <p>You can easily walk around Stone Town yourself, but it’s best to book a walking tour with Colors of Zanzibar to learn more about what you see.</p>

        <h1>WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT ZANZIBAR?</h1>
        <p>June to September is officially the dry season, meaning your chance of a sunny day is exceptionally high. In general, this is the busiest time to visit Zanzibar, and prices for accommodation will be at their highest. Zanzibar is near the equator, so the weather doesn’t sway too drastically, and you are almost guaranteed some sunshine on your vacation.</p>
        <!-- Placeholder for an image related to Zanzibar's weather -->

            <img src="/assets/How To Get To Zanzibar.jpeg" height="1400px" width="1000px" alt="How To Get To Zanzibar">
        </div>
        <p>April and May are the rainy seasons, and you can expect long downpours. Flooding is typical during these months, and many hotels will shut their doors. You’ll likely still have sunny weather, but I would expect to get wet during these months.</p>

        <h1>HOW TO GET TO ZANZIBAR</h1>
        <p>Not many US air carriers fly directly to Zanzibar. However, there are flight connections from major hubs in the Middle East, such as Muscat, Doha, Dubai, or Qatar. You’ll also be able to find flight connections through select European hubs like Amsterdam and London. From Africa, Johannesburg and Dar Es Salaam have the best connections.</p>

        <p>If you are in Dar Es Salaam, you can take the ferry from the port to Stone Town. Azam Marine runs daily ferries between the mainland and island and costs $35 one way.</p>
